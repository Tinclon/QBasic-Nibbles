# QBasic-Nibbles

When I was about 12 or 13, I discovered QBasic and Nibbles. As a nascent programmer, I decided to see if I could 'improve' the playing experience.

This is the same game, ported to javascript to run in the browser. Experience it here: https://tinclon.github.io/QBasic-Nibbles/Nibbles.html

In the javascript port, I tried to stay true to the original code that I had created in my youth. Thus, there are a few idiosyncracies in the codebase that as a more seasoned developer I likely wouldn't have coded, but for nostalgia, are left as is.

The original QBasic source from Microsoft is included for reference, as well as my modified QBasic source.
